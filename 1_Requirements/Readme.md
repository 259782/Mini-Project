# Requirements
## Introduction
 Students form a major part of any institution that concerns with. There are records that have to be maintained. But the institution finds it difficult to maintain large records of so many students of the organization. Huge heap files will be required. Plus there is no guarantee of such data in huge heap of files.
 Hence, to prevent these issues, I thought of making a Student Record System to help in quickly accessing and updating the data of students at a single place making it time efficient.
