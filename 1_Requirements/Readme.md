# Requirements
## Introduction
 * Students form a major part of any institution that concerns with. There are records that have to be maintained. But the institution finds it difficult to maintain large records of so many students of the organization. Huge heap files will be required. Plus there is no guarantee of such data in huge heap of files.
 * Hence, to prevent these issues, I thought of making a Student Record System to help in quickly accessing and updating the data of students at a single place making it time efficient.

## Research
## THE STUDENT RECORD SYSTEM
The student record system will help in managing students reports. It will help in saving time and effort. The information of the system will be handled in just one click.
* Student Database Management
The details of the students of the organisation can be stored in the database with the application.
* Results
The marksheet of the students can also be accesed and stored through this application.
* Performance
The performance of the students can be stored through this application.
* One click access
 It uses files as database to perform file handling operations such as add, search, modify and delete records to manage studentsâ€™ records with just a click.
